# ATRC Wright Scholar

## [Wright Scholar Program](http://www.wpafb.af.mil/Welcome/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/985968/wright-scholar-research-assistant-program/)

The Wright Scholar Research Assistant program is an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) initiative designed to expose high school juniors and seniors to various disciplines of engineering and science in an effort to further their interest in future STEM career options. Wright Scholars are employed as full-time, paid interns for 9 weeks during the summer. A panel of scientists, engineers, and educators will use a “blind” review system to select the students (names and other personal data are removed from applications prior to review to prevent biases). Students are competitively selected to work on a research project under the guidance of their assigned mentors. They also participate in weekly workshops, lectures, and tours to expand their knowledge of potential science and engineering career fields. At the end of the program, Wright Scholars are required to present their project work to their peers and mentors, and a program certificate is awarded.

***Benefits:***
1. Exciting research topics
2. Technical training
3. Mentorship from experienced AFRL scientists and engineers
4. Opportunities to tour AFRL laboratories
5. Networking through social events
6. Competitive stipend rates

## AFRL Center
The AFRL ATR Center Summer Program is a collaborative research experience for university professors, students, industry, and  government to work together to solve challenging Air Force problems in sensor processing and exploitation, including object 
detection, tracking and recognition. Students work with an Air Force mentor at Wright Patterson Air Force Base or 
nearby Wright State University, and have access to outstanding computing resources, measurement and modeling tools, and data.

# ATRC - Wright Scholar - Summer 2017

### [AFRL-RYAT](https://github.com/AFRL-RY/Explore-Coarse-3D-Reconstruction-Path-Planning-ATRC-Summer-2017) - Explore Coarse 3D Reconstruction Path Planning

View planning is the process of planning or selecting a set of images for 3D reconstruction. In many cases this process can improve the quality of the resulting 3D models, and reduce the number of images required, which in turn reduces the processing time. The objective of this project is to explore the application of view planning algorithms to SUAS platforms. The projected consist of several stages, each contingent on the success of the previous stage:
  * Test view planning algorithms on existing public data sets
  * Test view planning algorithms on non-public release data
  * Extend algorithms to produce coarse 3D reconstructions in flight and re-plan
